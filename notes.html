    <p>Questions still remaining after this lab:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do you give a Javascript function input to work with?
      We were going to attempt a function that tallied incorrect answers but 
      did not know how to execute this using HTML / Javascript. </li>
      <li>Is there any way to condense the functions to apply to different parts of the webpage?
      We had to write 10 separate functions, 1 for each button, but had to copy and paste the same things
      and change only one number for each?</li>
